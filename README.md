## Localhost setup
#### 1. Run `yarn install`
* This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed in [package.json](package.json) file.

#### 2. Run `yarn start`
* Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
* Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/src` folder, the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will hot reload.

#### 3. Run `yarn build` (for production env only)
* Builds the app for production to the build folder.
* It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
